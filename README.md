# Salary Classification Indeed Jobs
Using NLP models to predict salary range for technology jobs using scraped data from Indeed platform.

### Abstract 

Recent improvements in natural language processing technologies offer an opportunity to research and extract useful information from previously under-researched corpora of documents. We believe one such corpora are job postings (recruitment advertisements) in the 4 trillion-dollar information technology sector. We analyzed a subset of 14,867 documents (job posts) from the high-traffic job board, Indeed.com (Alexa traffic rank of 54 in US), looking for relationships between the documents and salary. From this preliminary review, we were able to determine that even with an imbalanced data set, we could predict salary up to a RSME score of 18.62 (in thousands of dollars) with an LSTM model and character encoding. Based on our study, we are optimistic about the utility of future studies and would like to offer the results of our study and recommendations for future research.
